        The goal for my game was to create a light-hearted commentary on social class. I was ‘inspired’ by recent events in British parliament regarding Liz Truss’s taxing policy - cutting taxes for people on incomes of 150,000 pounds or more. The
        aim of the game is to assist an aristocratic cow in ‘catching’ money and to avoid clicking on the tax bills. While we were looking at past examples of games from previous students, I thought the funniest games were those that had some sort of
        take on society or politics, so I knew from the start that I wanted to do some sort of subtle take on society.

        The idea and design part of the project had quite limited time, so I had to pick an idea and start sketching quickly. After mind-mapping and brainstorming a few ideas, I landed on Aristocows (Aristocratic cows...) After that I made a paper
        prototype of the game, which gave me a really clear idea of how I would draw the design on Illustrator.

      <p>Style: The styles I wanted to reflect was Two Dots & Year Walk. I think the final result of the game has more of a Year Walk style - the dark colours and character style.</p>
